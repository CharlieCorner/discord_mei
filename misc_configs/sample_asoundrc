# This .asoundrc file can be helpful in order to use Software-powered volume controls. This is useful for those Mics
#  that do not support a lot of dB gains out of the box. It's use is optional and should only be used in case the mic
#  input in ALSA-based systems is too low

# Configure ALSA to use the softvolmic plug as the default capture device
